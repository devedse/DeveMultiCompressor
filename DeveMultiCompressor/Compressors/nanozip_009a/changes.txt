...6 november, 2011
- fixed an issue in the graphical user interface (nanozip.exe)
  (thanks to egors23 for reporting it)

0.09 alpha, 4 november, 2011
- a new feature for running multiple compressors simultaneously for
  maximizing multi-threading utilization at the cost of compression ratio.
  the trade-off (auto by default) can be controlled with -p parameter
- optimizations to nz_lzhd and lzpf compressors
- fixed extremely rare false positive fletcher16 checksum error (thanks to
  sergey for reporting this)
- fixed a rare bug in nz_lzpf and nz_lzpf_large (thanks to "flaker"
  for reporting it)
- fixed a rare bug ("error 13", concerning modes -cd...-cc) (thanks
  again to sergey for reporting the bug)
- fixed path conversion ('\') on linux (thanks to "onno" for reporting
  the bug)
- fixed (yet another attempt) problems with large memory settings (thanks
  to patrick and others who reported these)
- fixed "error 7834538" (thanks to pat357, dennis and others for reporting)
  please write feedback again if this error re-appears
- changes to the command line options: removed the 'q' and 'unix' -commands
  and added a switch (-pause) to pause before quitting. sfx module is
  no longer integrated into the executable, but it is a separate file

0.08 alpha, 3 june, 2010
- nz_optimum1 & 2 text compression (bwt with dc and qlfc models) is replaced
  with the nanozipltcb parallel compressor. the speed should not be expected
  to equal nanozipltcb though
- multithreading optimizations (dual thread) for nz_optimum1 & 2 binary
  compression. (proper parallelization may be implemented sometime later)
- miscellanous compression optimizations for nz_optimum1 & 2
- optimizations for nz_lzhd. around 5-10% faster compression (try limiting the
  use of memory for extra speed)
- multithreading optimizations for nz_lzhd and nz_lzhds compression (dual
  threads only 5-10%)
- multithreading decompression for nz_lzhd and nz_lzhds. limited to about
  four threads with 20-40% speedup
- new compressor: nz_lzhd_parallel (-cdp), a modified nz_lzhd compression
  algorithm for multi-core cpus. sometimes slower than nz_lzhd. compression
  ratio varies depending on the number of cores/processors available
- new compressor: nz_lzhd_parallel_extra (-cdP), high compression variant
  of the parallel algorithm
- small tunings for nz_lzhds
- new compressor: nz_lzhds_parallel (-cDp), a modified nz_lzhds compression
  algorithm for multi-core cpus. sometimes faster than nz_lzhds. compression
  ratio depends on the number of cores/processors available
- new compressor: nz_lzhds_parallel_extra (-cDP), high compression variant
  of the nz_lzhds_parallel algorithm
- faster audio compression for nz_lzpf. the old audio compression
  is now used for lz_lzpf_large
- faster (50%) audio compression and sometimes better ratio for nz_cm. some
  improvements for nz_opt1 & 2 also
- t -switch sets number of threads (should be set to the number of idle
  cores in the system) (a critical setting for the parallel compressors)
- br and bw -switches set read/write buffer sizes. this setting
  effects io-in/out time (default: auto, 1-32 MB for each)
- fixed bug (at least for linux) when various nz compressors reporting
  "out of memory" without a reason or failing otherwise with large memory
  settings (thanks to michael and many others who have pointed this out).
  windows versions remain untested
- fixed bug when opening archive failed in the gui (thanks to richard for
  reporting the bug)
- s -command simulates compression (compress without writing output)
- forcemem -switch is deprecated (a warning is displayed in case
  of low memory)
- l -command list output should be more readable now
- gui support cancelling compression and decompression jobs
- various other changes
- thanks to david bynane for the windows icon
- note: the compression ratio may vary even on multiple runs on the same
  hardware for the parallel compressors. these compressors are experimental
  and may not be very useful for platform with less than 4 cores. run with -t1
  (or on a single core platform) will result slow speed and low compression
  ratio. decompressors are updated in such way that there is no distinction
  made for the parallel compressors, so the basic compressor name is listed
  for decompressing. these compressors have not been properly tested on
  windows and the multithreading implementation might be inefficient
  compared to the linux versions.

0.07 alpha, 4 july, 2009
- multithreading for nz_lzpf and lz_lzpf_large (for 2 processors)
  for both compression and decompression (nz_lzpf is 20-40% faster)
  with no changes to compression ratio
- gui displays elapsed time, remaining time and speed
- fixed a bug in nz_lzpf and lz_lzpf_large
- fixed a bug which caused incompatibility between 64-bit and
  32-bit versions
- fixed a bug in the archiver core, which caused faulty archives
  with the store method (can also happen with compression enabled)
  thanks to mod_john for reporting the bug
- miscellaneous performance related tunings

0.06 alpha, 13 february, 2009
- small compression related tunings for nz_optimum1-2 and nz_cm.
  artificial images still compress very badly, this will be fixed
  in the future
- linux support (command line interface only)
- 64-bit support for windows and linux (command line interface)
- 32-bit self-extracting archives with command line interface
- new command line switches: -sp (strip paths from files)
  and -fo (re/store unix file ownership)

0.05 alpha, 20 october, 2008
- nz_optimum1 compressor is replaced with a new experimental branch.
  the compression performance is now dramatically different for
  non-textual data. typically the speed is 25-80% slower but the
  compression ratio is 5-15% better
- improved audio compression for nz_optimum1, 10% faster compression
  and decompression (with a variation of <0.1% in compression ratio)
- improved nz_lzpf_large compression (this compressor will likely be
  replaced with a better one in the future)
- fixed a bug which sometimes caused incorrect timestamps
- fixed a bug which caused files size of zero not to be
  processed (thanks to nania francesco antonio for reporting the bug)
- fixed adding non-existent files into archive. this no longer
  produces an empty archive
- fixed a bug which caused memory to be automatically reduced
  too much for nz_optimum1 and nz_optimum2
- command line interface gives more details when listing archive contents
- miscellanous fixes/tunings/optimizations

0.04 alpha, 19 august, 2008
- improved nz_optimum2 compression ratio for non-textual data.
  decompression is slightly slower
- revised audio compression for nz_optimum1, nz_lzhd and nz_lzhds.
  nz_optimum1 is about 2x faster (slightly worse compression).
  nz_lzhd has higher compression ratio and nz_lzhds has both higher
  compression ratio and speed
- other compressors might be slightly faster on audio as well
- improved text compression performance for nz_lzhd and nz_lzhds
- small tweaks for nz_cm
- corrupted/artificial audio files might compress better
- fixed a bug which sometimes caused decompression to use 2x memory

  corrupted (thanks to jim for providing a sample)

0.03 alpha, 31 july, 2008
- fixed a bug (thanks again to pat357 for reporting it)

0.02 alpha, 30 july, 2008
- nz_optimum2 compression speed is about 5-10% faster and decompression
  speed 10-35% faster for non-textual data (compression ratio may vary +-0.5%)
- worst case speed optimizations (up to 2x faster) for nz_optimum2,
  thanks to pat357 and christian schneider for providing data samples
- as an experiment, nz_cm audio compression is now configured for
  slightly higher compression (for some files), it's 2x slower compressing
- changed memory configurations for nz_optimum1, nz_optimum2 and nz_cm.
  nz_cm may compress large files with better, compression may also vary
  with the opt1 and opt2 compressors
- memory usage will be automatically reduced if the defined amount
  cannot be utilized by the selected compressor (for the particular files)
- fixed a bug which caused a crash (thanks to radek liska for
  providing a sample)
- fixed a bug which caused a crash (thanks to christian schneider for
  providing a sample)

  multifile compression with nz_optimum1, nz_optimum2, nz_cm
- fixed a bug (thanks to pat357 for reporting it)
- fixed 2 bugs which may have caused crashes
- all compressors should now report memory usage accurately
  and custom memory settings should be approximately followed
- default/standard memory usage is now set to 400-450 mb
- memory usage will be automatically reduced if no such amount
  of memory is available
- fixed large file support (technically nz format supports
  infinite file size) (thanks to zonder for reporting the bug)
- fixed '//' which appeared sometimes using the gui
- help command option shows advanced options. some of these options
  may be a help for benchmarkers with non-configurable automated tools
