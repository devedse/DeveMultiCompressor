VERSION HISTORY
---------------

Newest entries are at the bottom.
Dates are in YYYY.MM.DD format.


DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ7

An .exe model and filter are added.  Context maps are improved using 16-bit
checksums to reduce collisions.  The state table uses probabilistic updates
for large counts, more states that remember the last bit, and decreased
discounting of the opposite count.  It is implemented as a fixed table.
There are also many minor changes.

DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ8A

The user interface supports directory compression and drag and drop.
The preprocessor segments the input into blocks and uses more robust
EXE detection.  An indirect context model was added.  There is no
dictionary preprocessor like PAQ8B/C/D/E.

DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ8F

Different models, usually from paq8hp*. Also changed rate from 8 to 7. A bug
in Array was fixed that caused the program to silently crash upon exit.

DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ8J

1) Slightly improved sparse model.
2) Added new family of sparse contexts. Each byte mapped to 3-bit value, where
different values corresponds to different byte classes. For example, input
byte 0x00 transformed into 0, all bytes that less then 16 -- into 5, all
punctuation marks (ispunct(c)!=0) -- into 2 etc. Then this flags from 11
previous bytes combined into 32-bit pseudo-context.

All this improvements gives only 62 byte on BOOK1, but on binaries archive size
reduced on 1-2%.

DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ8JA

Introduced distance model. Distance model uses distance to last occurrence
of some anchor char (0x00, space, newline, 0xff), combined with previous
characters as context. This slightly improves compression of files with
variable-width record data.

DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ8JB

Restored recordModel(), broken in paq8hp*. Slightly tuned indirectModel().

DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ8JC

Changed the APMs in the Predictor. Up to a 0.2% improvement for some files.

DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ8JD

Added DMCModel.  Removed some redundant models from SparseModel and other
minor tuneups.  Changes introduced in PAQ8K were not carried over.

PAQ8L v.2

Changed Mixer::p() to p() to fix a compiler error in Linux
(patched by Indrek Kruusa, Apr. 15, 2007).

DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ8L, PAQ8M

Modified JPEG model by Jan Ondrus (paq8fthis2).  The new model improves
compression by using decoded pixel values of current and adjacent blocks
as context.  PAQ8M was an earlier version of the new JPEG model
(from paq8fthis).

DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ8N

Improved bmp model. Slightly faster.

DIFFERENCES FROM PAQ8O

Modified JPEG model by Jan Ondrus (paq8fthis4).
Added PGM (grayscale image) model form PAQ8I.
Added grayscale BMP model to PGM model.
Ver. 2 can be compiled using either old or new "for" loop scoping rules.
Added APM and StateMap from LPAQ1
Code optimizations from Enrico Zeidler
Detection of BMP 4,8,24 bit and PGM 8 bit images before compress
On non BMP,PGM,JPEG data mem is lower
Fixed bug in BMP 8-bit detection in other files like .exe

- Some code modified in 1-bit/8-bit/24-bit BMP detection (compression size is different only for 1-bit BMPs = was wrong starting offset in old version)


pap8px_v9 by Jan Ondrus
2009.05.08
- now there are only im24bitModel, im8bitModel and im1bitModel instead of im24bitModel, pgmModel, bmpModel8, rgbModel8, bmpModel1 and pbmModel
- all image header detection is removed from models (only place for image detection is detect procedure)

- RGB detection can detect images with more channels (3 or 4) - channels are compressed independently using im8bitModel (IMAGE8 block)
- during compression can't be printed such info BMP(width x height), instead of it program prints info about blocks: blocktype(size in bytes)


pap8px_v10 by Simon Berger
2009.05.08
- Added 24-bit tga compression
- Added More checks for Tiff

pap8px_v29 by Simon Berger
2009.05.21
- Changed the structure of the compress function a lot. It now stops using encode_default instead it compresses directly from input file.
  In files without EXE data there is no temporary file anymore and surely also no comparing.


pap8px_v30 by Jan Ondrus
2009.05.21

pap8px_v38 by Jan Ondrus
2009.05.30
- Experimental detection and transformation of CD sectors in CD images(only type #1) as done in ECM -> sequence of sectors is detected as new block type : cd
- Functions for computing ECC and EDC are taken from UNECM decoder (GPL) by Neill Corlett
- Ro test detection/transformation you can use -0 switch


pap8px_v39 by Jan Ondrus
2009.05.30
- Fixed bug: conflict in CD and EXE detection (exe detected inside cd image could cause bad things)


pap8px_v40 by Jan Ondrus
2009.05.30
- limited maximal size of cd block to 38535168 (16384 sectors) so larger cd images are divided into more blocks and user can see progress


pap8px_v41 by Jan Ondrus
2009.05.30
- disabled detecting anything else when CD is detected.


pap8px_v42 by Jan Ondrus
2009.05.31
- fixed bug: special models for special blocks (image/audio) wasn't used when found after CD block due to wrong/missing size of encoded cd block calculation.


pap8px_v43 by Jan Ondrus
2009.06.01
- improved CD sectors transformation - addresses are not saved which improves efficiency of transformation and allow possibility for future detection images/audio inside CD image data


pap8px_v44 by Jan Ondrus
2009.06.01
- fixed bug: wrong size of encoded CD block


pap8px_v45 by Jan Ondrus
2009.06.01
- detection images/audio/exe/cd/jpeg blocks inside transformed cd block data
- works recursively (maximal deep of recursion is set to 5 - controlled by #define MAX_ITER 5)
- each CD block now contains subblocks
- meaning of percentage is changed - it shows progress for individual block (i think this is bad and will try to return previous behavior in next versions)


pap8px_v46 by Jan Ondrus
2009.06.02
- added support for CD-ROM Mode 2 XA (CD-ROM/XA) Form 1 (2352 bytes) sectors

2009.06.11
- added new decompression system from Simon Berger/paq8q
- new style of block segmentation information during compression


pap8px_v55 by Jan Ondrus
2009.06.13
- new version of wavModel
- recordModel is no longer used inside wavModel which may lead to increased speed and small loss in compression ratio.


pap8px_v56 by Jan Ondrus
2009.06.13
- before value from sum is used it is converted to float:  sum=float(sum);


pap8px_v57 by Jan Ondrus
2009.06.13
- converting to float wasn't good idea - this could hurt compression ratio very much -> instead of it sum is rounded in this version: sum=round(sum);


pap8px_v58 by Jan Ondrus
2009.06.17
- changed end of exe-block detection (size of no x86 code increased from 4kb to 16kb)

2009.06.20
- improved wavModel
  1.) Replaced round(sum) with floor(sum+0.5)
  2.) Some changes in contexts (improving compression)
  3.) RecordModel is used in wavModel again (because it improves compression mainly for 8bit audio)


pap8px_v61 by Jan Ondrus
2009.07.25
- Added a simple color transformation to paq8px. All detected 24-bit image data are transformed. Different formats have different color order RGB (.tiff) vs. BGR (.bmp) -> this could cause different compression for the same image in different formats.


pap8px_v62 by Jan Ondrus
2009.08.16
- some double brackets removed
- fixed some compiler warnings


pap8px_v63 by Jan Ondrus

- modified the BMP parsing code to detect embedded DIB's in executable files.


pap8px_v77b by Márcio Pais
2017.07.10
- fixed a small error in the code
- added 2 new contexts from EMMA to the record model.


pap8px_v78 by Márcio Pais
2017.07.15
- Changed the JPEG model to be able to detect embedded thumbnails and to compress MJPEG video frames (by loading the default huffman tables).
- The recursion level on the thumbnail detection can be configured by a simple constant change, currently it can detect a thumbnail within a thumbnail.
- Added 5 contexts from my grayscale 8bpp model in EMMA to the 8bpp and 24bpp models in paq8px.


pap8px_v79 by Márcio Pais
2017.07.17
- Modified the 24bpp image model to also be able to compress 32bpp images, to be able to account for padding in BMP/DIB images, and changed one of its mixer contexts. 
- Changed a mixer context for the 8bpp image model.


pap8px_v80 by Márcio Pais
2017.07.23
- Fixed the JPEG thumbnail detection bug and other bugs in previous versions.
- Modified the record model.


pap8px_v81 by Márcio Pais
2017.07.24
- This version detects if a 8bpp image is grayscale or a color-palette image by parsing the color table, if available 
  (for PGM files a grayscale image is assumed, the check is made for BMP/DIB and TGA images). 
  This is done because their characteristics are completely different, so they require different approaches.
- Modified the 8bpp image model to account for both variants, 
- And added 5 simple contexts for the color-palette branch. 
- Modified a global mixer context, it should give better compression on executable files.


pap8px_v82 by Márcio Pais

  DisFilter by Fabian Giesen (http://www.farbrausch.de/~fg/code/disfilter/) and the x86/x64 model in EMMA.


pap8px_v99 by Márcio Pais
2017.08.19

pap8px_v103 by Márcio Pais
2017.08.31
- Made a few improvements to the wordModel, 
- Created a model for 4bpp images, which are very common in executables.


pap8px_v104 by Márcio Pais
2017.09.02

- Modified the existing 24/32bpp image model to also compress the filtered PNG pixel data.
- Created a few example contexts designed to model such data
- Tweaked the existing (non-PNG, unfiltered pixel data) model a bit.


pap8px_v105 by Jan Ondrus
2017.09.03
- simplified block type handling routines
- because we now have 4-bit image model we should use it for 4-bit pdf image (we used here the 8-bit model instead)

pap8px_v114 by Márcio Pais
2017.10.15
- Made a few more improvements to the 24/32bpp image model, especially on the PNG variant.
- The 8bpp color-indexed model is also slightly improved.
- The heuristic for the record model now attempts to detect 24bpp images, and the model now uses 2 contexts for 8bpp and 24bpp images. This helps on images that aren't detected by the parsers, such as Tif images.

paq8px_v137 by Zoltán Gotthardt
2018.02.14
- Fixed some compatibility issues with older compilers
- Changed some [] arrays to Array<> in order to detect out of bound operations
- Now you can disable/enable compilation of certain models/transformations (ZLIB, TEXTMODEL, WORDMODEL, WAVMODEL)
- The "String" class is extended with new functions to support the new command line interface
- A new "FileName" class to represent a filename/filepath.
- Introduced some file/folder helper functions (examinepath(), getfilesize(), appendtofile(), isoutputredirected() - see source)
- Dispatcher for SSE2/AVX2 neural network functions
- Remark: needed to switch jpegmodel from function to class for the new CPU-dispatched Mixer.
- Improvements - for users
  - Archive names are now generated by adding the full version (e.g. .paq8px137) to the input filename.
  - Archives are now comparable - based solely on their content regardless of the input filename and path
  - Input filename and its path is not stored in the archive anymore.
  - Wildcard support and folder compression is removed for the sake of a list-based file enumeration.
  - If you wish to compress more files, you'll have to gather the filenames (with optional relative paths) in a text file.
  - When compressing multiple files you may now save extra information about those files (date, permissions,
    file attributes, even your own remarks). But you have to gather it yourself. See the help screen for more info.
  - All "Windows drag and drop" support is removed:
  - No pause and no "Close this window or press ENTER to continue..." message at the end.
  - Output file is not created automatically in the folder of the input file. It is created in the current folder or in the folder you specify.
  - Removed default compression level "5" (it was part of the drag-and-drop support). Now you have to specify the compression level explicitly.
  - Separated the ambiguous -d command line switch to -d (decompress) and -t (test)
  - Now you can log compression results (size, time, memory, command line options) in a logfile (use the -log command line switch).
  - SSE2/AVX2 dot product and training is now contained in the same executable. The executable runs on "all" CPUs.
  - After launch it detects the vectorization support, which you can override from the command line.
  - In decompression/testing mode you can now print the command options used for compression (use the -v (verbose) command line switch).
  - If screen output is redirected to a file then "onscreen" information is printed without the progress indicator -> no garbage in the captured output.
  - The optional compression switches (b/e/t/a/s) come after the compression level without the brackets.
  - You can give the command line parameters in any order you want. Only the order of the input and output specification is a must (obviously).
  - Rewritten help screen

- Fixed some minor bugs and typos
- Print the selected vectorization info only if the user wants/needs to know.
- On single file mode (almost) the same information was printed 3 times on screen (input file size). Now it prints it only twice (at the beginning of segmentation and in the summary) like in the old days.

paq8px_v156 by Zoltán Gotthardt
2018.08.16
- Small compression enhancement: in ContextMap 
  - skipping mixing (add(0)) when state == 0  (unknown context).
- Small compression enhancement: in matchModel 
  - the default context was c0, now it is 0 (indicating "no match" or "mismatch")
-- on mismatch, delta mode didn't switch immediately: fixed
  - skipping mixing (add(0)) when state is empty (unknown context).
  - tiny reduction in memory use
- Small compression improvement: normalmodel to the front
  - moved normalmodel in front of the special models improving compression of images and files containing mixed content
- Minor fixes: in wordModel
  - pC (previous character) was not converted to lowercase before use.
  - added blocktype==TEXT_EOL condition where blocktype==TEXT was used.
- Fixed: multiple file mode
  - since v137 compression could degrade significantly due to a bug around block type/size detection
  - it did not affect compression in single file mode
- Cleanup: the global "f4" context was updated in the Predictor and was used both by wordModel and sparseModel. Moved all code to wordModel where it ought to be.
- Cleanup: "normal model" is now a real model (not embedded in ContextModel)
- Miscellaneous cleanup in code/comments


paq8px_v157 by Zoltán Gotthardt
2018.08.18
- New hash functions (currently used in matchModel only)
- Compression enhancement: "skipping mixing (add(0)) when state is empty (unknown context)" from v156 is now "skipping some mixing when state is empty (unknown context)"
- Compression and speed enhancement: eliminated a useless prediction from ContextMap and ContextMap2
- Tiny compression enhancement: rounding in ContextMap and ContextMap2 (1-2-byte gain only)
- "c8" in exeModel is now global - it may be referenced from other models. Unfortunately using it in matchModel would yield only a very tiny speedup for the cost of more code. Therefore, this matchModel change is not committed.
- Enhancements in matchModel:
  - using a bit more diffuse hash calculation for less collision 
  - now 3 sequences are monitored (lengths: 9, 7, 5)
  - matching is performed all the way (not just for a minimal length of 2, but for 9->7->5)
  - matching expansion didn't work out; the code is provided, it may just need some tweaking
- Miscellaneous cleanup in code/comments

- Disabled detection of PNM images (PPM, PGM, PBM)
- New "text" / "text - eol" detection (with a utf8 validating automaton)
